# Solid for React developer

The biggest different is on reactive handling. In React, every change is handled by the reconciler that runs periodically. Whereas in Solid, only reactive changes will lead to re-rendering, which is great for performance and allows a good level of control - however, using `Array.map` will only ever run initially. If the contents of the array changed, you'd either need `mapArray` or `For`. 

Also, you can't destructure `props` in Solid because it will lose its reactivity. You can see it in [this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/trusting-jasper-ltzxi?file=/src/main.tsx).

Other than that, it's pretty much the same thing. Here we'll cover some of the control flow available on Solid. There is [an article on the documentation](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#react) comparing React to Solid.

## What's changed?
* useState -> [createSignal](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#createsignal)
* useEffect -> [createEffect](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#createeffect)
* useMemo -> [createMemo](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#creatememo)

## Conditional rendering

You could still use conditionals like React, there is no downside to it.

**React**
```jsx
export default function Awesome({ awesome }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {awesome ? (
        <h1>React is awesome!</h1>
      ) : (
        <h1>Oh no ðŸ˜¢</h1>
      )};
    </article>
  )
}
```

**Solid**
```jsx
import { Show } from 'solid-js' 

export default function Awesome(props) {
  return (
    <Show when={props.awesome} fallback={<h1>Solid is still awesome, though.</h1>}>
      <h1>Solid is awesome!</h1>
    </Show>
  )
}
```

## List rendering

**React**
```jsx
export default function Recipe({ ingredients }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {ingredients.map((ingredient, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{ingredient}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Solid**

You could still use `ingredients.map()` like you'd do on React, but it's less optimized for changes. There's a helper component built in on Solid that's more optimized for changes.

```jsx
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export default function Recipe(props) {
  return (
    <ul>
      <For each={props.ingredients}>
        {(ingredient, index) => (
          <li>{ingredient}</li>
        )}
      </For>
    </ul>
  )
}
```
